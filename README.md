# About

This is a demonstration of using [dextool mutate](https://github.com/joakim-brannstrom/dextool/tree/master/plugin/mutate) on open source projects.

The intention is to demonstrate that the tool is usable on a wide range of open
source projects in practise and to serve as example of how to use it to others.
I hope it will help you, as a reader, to get started.
